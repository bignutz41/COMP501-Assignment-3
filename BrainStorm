Country: AI
City: AI Music
Town: Ethics and Copyright Issues with AI Music/ Degradation of Art

Importance: AI has the potential to take a sample of an artist singing and then keep pumping out content that is marketed as by the artist without any actual input from the artist

Could be used to bring out new music from deceased musicians

Implications of a label/company “owning” the rights to the voice of artists for the purposes of AI:
-	Artists have no control
-	Up and coming artists could get trapped in bad contracts (already a huge problem which AI could make worse
-	Making music would become so much more accessible and easier – could lead to a huge oversaturation of the market
